# ServerSideSearch

This script allows you to quickly check out and search your server. You don't
need SSH access, just upload a single file (`sss.php`) and open it with your
browser. You can change the folders and do an extended search (with or without
RegExp). The search does a fulltext search (searches the content of the files).

## Setup

Open the `sss.php` file in an editor and write your password into the `$password`
variable (e.g. `$password = 'your password';`). You can hash your plain password
once with md5 (e.g. `$password = '513106c051f94528f1d386926aa65e1a';`) optionally.
You can change the username, too (the default username is `FirePanther`, case
insensitive).

After adding the password upload the `sss.php` file with your FTP client to your
server/webspace. If you're done using it you can remove it just for security
reasons.

The other files are just for developers. You don't have to concat the files,
with the already concated `sss.php` file you can start straightaway.

## Password

The password variable (@see Setup step) is required (can't be empty). There is
no default password just for security reasons (if you leave the default password
and forget the file on your server someone could see your files like your
database php file with the password).

Just for a little extra security you can set your password md5 hashed (once).
If you just want the quickly search some files on your server and remove it
you can add a short password without hashing it.
