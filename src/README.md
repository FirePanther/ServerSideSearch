Rename `config.sample.php` into `config.php` and edit the file (don't duplicate,
if the smaple still exists, the script will bypass the password for git).
Change the username and write your password. Instead of a clear text password
you can add an md5 checksum of your password.

After editing these files you have to concat it with the `../concat.php` script
or with running `gulp` (don't forget `npm i` before).

If you just want to edit your username and password, without concating, just edit
the `../sss.php` script instead.
